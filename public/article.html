                                    <p class="card-text">The Sanskrit word chakra translates to a wheel or disk. In yoga, meditation, and Ayurveda, this term refers to wheels of energy throughout the body. There are seven main chakras that align along the spine, starting
                                        from the base of the spine to the crown of the head. The spheres run along the spine, but extend through and past the front, back, and both sides of your body. Chakras are a spinning vortex of energy that is not
                                        seen by the human eye but can be seen, felt, and sensed with intuition. This invisible healing energy, called prana, is a vital life force, which keeps us vibrant, healthy, and alive. What’s Held in a Chakra? Chakras
                                        store the energy of thoughts, feelings, memories, experiences, and actions. They influence and direct our present and future mindset, behavior, emotional health, and actions. The life force in each chakra can be
                                        processed, transmuted and released so that we consciously manifest what we want to call in, rather than experience more of the same. Chakra healing is the intentional practice of connecting with our stored energy,
                                        so we may understand how our past is influencing the present and the future. Prana informs us, and influences our actions and behaviors, determining our health, career opportunities, relationships, and more. The
                                        subtle body depicts how our inner reality creates our outer reality. The Importance of the Main Chakras in the Body These swirling wheels of energy correspond to massive nerve centers in the body. Each of the seven
                                        main chakras contains bundles of nerves and major organs as well as our psychological, emotional, and spiritual states of being. Since everything is moving, it’s essential that our seven main chakras stay open,
                                        aligned, and fluid. If there is a blockage, energy flows are restricted. Think of something as simple as your bathtub drain. If you allow too much hair to go into the drain, the bathtub will back up with water,
                                        stagnate, and eventually bacteria and mold will grow.
                                        <!--So it is too with our bodies and the chakras. A bathtub is simple; it’s physical so the fix is easy. Keeping a chakra open is a bit more of a challenge, but
                                        not so difficult when you have awareness. Since mind, body, soul, and spirit are intimately connected, awareness of an imbalance in one area through chakra meditation will help bring the others back into balance.
                                         Take, for example, a wife who has recently lost her husband. She develops acute bronchitis, which remains in the chest, and then gets chest pains each time she coughs. The whole heart chakra is affected in this
                                        case. If she realizes the connection between the loss and bronchitis, healing will occur much faster if she honors the grieving process and treats that as well as the physical ailment. Connecting with Your Chakras
                                        You may experience your chakras, consciousness centers, in meditation, visualization, yoga, Reiki, crystal healing, sound healing, acupuncture, or a variety of different ways.
                                        Some people can see the swirling energy
                                        in their mind’s eye, or they can feel the vortex with their hands when they hover their hands over their bodies. Others feel sensations in their bodies or mental and emotional shifts that correlate with the chakras.
                                         You may also get in touch with the thoughts and emotions stored in each vortex with chakra journaling. As you begin to feel, sense, or see your chakras, their flow may feel underactive or overactive. It may feel
                                        deficient and contracted, or expansive and healthy.
                                         A healthy chakra system will include chakras that are bright in color, balanced in size, and flowing at a healthy speed. Building from Ground Up When healing the
                                        chakras, it’s wise to start with the root chakra, and explore ideas related to safety, nourishment, belonging, finances, and family. From there, you may move up the spine to the sacral chakra and so forth. The health
                                        of the lower chakras is crucial to the health of the upper chakras. Without a sense of grounding, stability, and safety, it may feel jarring to open up the third eye or crown chakras that are related to intuition,
                                        Divine connection, and higher knowing. -->

                                    <p class="card-text">Self care is the way in which we care for our mental, emotional and physical health. It’s activities we do to keep us as our best selves. Practicing self care is an action-oriented way that we can show ourselves self-love.
                                        Self-love is exactly what it sounds like, loving yourself. It means loving all aspects of yourself, by accepting your flaws, your weaknesses, the things you don’t always like and holding high standards for your
                                        own well-being and happiness. For many people, these concepts of self care and self-love can be new. After all we are often taught that prioritizing yourself or your needs is selfish and that you should focus your
                                        energies on other people. But practicing self-love doesn’t make you selfish, or a narcissist, it just means that you won’t settle for less than you deserve, because you understand and respect your own needs. Practicing
                                        self care and self-love often just means extending the same respect and care you have for others to yourself. As the saying goes, we are often our own worst critics. Practicing self-love means ditching that old
                                        adage and moving forward, by creating an environment for yourself in which you can make mistakes, grow and flourish. Working self care into your routine with small, achievable steps will increase your self-kindness,
                                        self-love and common humanity. Steps to Practice Self-Love Everyday 1. Recognizing and accepting your emotional state: No one is happy all the time. Nor are they positive or the best version of themselves each and
                                        every day. An important part of self-love is holding yourself to reasonable standards. You must acknowledge that some days will be better than others, and that it’s totally okay to have an off day, or week or slump
                                        period. It’s important to check in with your emotional state frequently, so that you can recognize your moods and learn to accept them.
                                        <!-- In practice, this means not acting like things are fine, when you know they
                                        aren’t. How frustrated do you feel when someone says “I’m fine” or “It’s nothing” when they clearly are NOT fine and it clearly IS something?? Don’t play those same games with yourself. Tune into your emotional
                                        state so that you can act and plan accordingly! Not only must you recognize your emotional state, but you need to accept it as well. And a key part of acceptance is tailoring your plans or your routine to your current
                                        state. Learning to check in with your emotional state is the basis of any good self care routine. -->
